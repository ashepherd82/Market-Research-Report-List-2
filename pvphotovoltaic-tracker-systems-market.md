<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PV(Photovoltaic) Tracker Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Axis Trackers</li><li>Dual Axis Trackers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The PV Tracker Systems Market consists of two main types: Single Axis Trackers and Dual Axis Trackers. Single Axis Trackers are designed to move solar panels on a single axis, usually following the sun's east-west path, optimizing energy generation throughout the day. Dual Axis Trackers, on the other hand, can move solar panels on two axes, allowing them to track the sun's movement both vertically and horizontally. Dual Axis Trackers provide higher energy production due to their ability to constantly adjust the angle of the panels for optimal sunlight exposure.</p></p>
