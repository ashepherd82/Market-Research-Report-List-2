<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pea Protein Processing Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Fractionation</li><li>Dry Fractionation</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The pea protein processing equipment market includes two main types of processing methods: wet fractionation and dry fractionation. Wet fractionation involves separating the protein from other pea components using water-based extraction methods. This process requires equipment like separators, centrifuges, and filters to separate and purify the protein. On the other hand, dry fractionation involves the separation of protein by air-based processes. This method requires equipment like air classifiers, sieves, and mills to separate and isolate the protein from other pea components without using water. Both types of equipment are essential for efficient pea protein processing.</p></p>
