<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Overhead Line Fault Indicator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pole-mounted Indicator</li><li>Conductor-mounted Indicator</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The pole-mounted indicator market refers to the sale and use of fault indicators that are attached to utility poles. These indicators are used to detect faults or disruptions in overhead power lines and notify maintenance crews of the issue. On the other hand, the conductor-mounted indicator market involves the use of fault indicators that are directly mounted on the power line conductors themselves. These indicators serve the same purpose as pole-mounted indicators but differ in their installation method. Both markets cater to the needs of utility companies and help ensure the smooth functioning of power distribution systems.</p></p>
