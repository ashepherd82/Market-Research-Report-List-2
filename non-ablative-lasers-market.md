<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Non-ablative Lasers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Ablative Fractionated Lasers</li><li>Non-Ablative Non-Fractionated Lasers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Non-ablative lasers are a type of laser treatment used in various medical and cosmetic procedures. There are two main types of non-ablative lasers: non-ablative fractionated lasers and non-ablative non-fractionated lasers. </p><p>Non-ablative fractionated lasers work by delivering precise laser beams that create microscopic channels in the skin, leaving surrounding tissue intact. This stimulates collagen production and helps improve skin texture and tone.</p><p>Non-ablative non-fractionated lasers, on the other hand, deliver laser energy in a broader pattern without creating microscopic channels. This method heats the deeper layers of the skin, promoting collagen remodeling and tightening.</p><p>Both types of non-ablative lasers offer non-invasive treatments with minimal downtime, making them popular in the medical and cosmetic fields.</p></p>
