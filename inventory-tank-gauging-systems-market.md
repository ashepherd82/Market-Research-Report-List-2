<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Inventory Tank Gauging Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Point level instruments</li><li>Continuous level instruments</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Point level instruments are used in inventory tank gauging systems to provide a discrete indication when the liquid level reaches a certain point. This helps in determining the minimum and maximum fill levels and prevents overflow or run dry situations. On the other hand, continuous level instruments provide real-time monitoring of the liquid level throughout the tank. They allow for accurate tracking and control of inventory levels, ensuring efficient operations and preventing downtime or loss of valuable materials. Both point level and continuous level instruments are crucial components in inventory tank gauging systems.</p></p>
