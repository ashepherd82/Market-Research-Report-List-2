<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mini Split Air Conditioning Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air Cooling System</li><li>Water Cooling System</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Mini-split air conditioning systems are divided into two types: air cooling system and water cooling system. </p><p>An air cooling system utilizes refrigerant to cool the air before distributing it into the room. It works by absorbing heat from indoor air and transferring it outside. These systems are efficient, cost-effective, and easy to install, making them popular for residential and commercial applications.</p><p>On the other hand, a water cooling system uses water as the medium to remove heat from the indoor air. It circulates cold water through the evaporator coil to cool the air and then discharges the heat to the outside environment. These systems are typically used in larger commercial buildings or industrial settings where higher cooling capacities are required.</p></p>
