<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thermal Overload Relay Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Melting Alloy Thermal Overload Relay</li><li>Bimetallic Strip Thermal Overload Relay</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In the thermal overload relay market, there are two main types: melting alloy thermal overload relay and bimetallic strip thermal overload relay. Melting alloy thermal overload relays use a melting alloy element that melts when the temperature exceeds a certain level, causing the relay to trip and disconnect the circuit. On the other hand, bimetallic strip thermal overload relays utilize a bimetallic strip made of two different metals with different coefficients of thermal expansion. When heated, the strip bends and triggers the relay to disconnect the circuit. Both types serve the same purpose of protecting electrical circuits from overheating.</p></p>
