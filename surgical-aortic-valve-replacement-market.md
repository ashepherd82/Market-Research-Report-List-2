<p><h1>Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement Market Size, Share & Trends Analysis Report By Material, By Type, By End-user, By Region, And Segment Forecasts, 2024 - 2031</h1></p><p><strong>Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement (SAVR) is a procedure aimed at treating aortic valve stenosis or regurgitation. In this surgical intervention, a damaged or diseased aortic valve is replaced with a prosthetic valve to restore normal blood flow. SAVR is typically performed as an open-heart surgery, involving a sternotomy (where the breastbone is cut open) to gain access to the heart.</p><p>The Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement Market is projected to exhibit substantial growth during the forecast period (2021-2026). The market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 11.8%, primarily driven by factors such as the increasing prevalence of valvular heart diseases and the growing aging population. Aortic valve disorders, especially aortic stenosis, are common in aged individuals, leading to a rising demand for surgical interventions such as SAVR.</p><p>Moreover, advancements in surgical techniques, including minimally invasive approaches, have positively influenced the growth of the SAVR market. Minimally invasive SAVR procedures offer benefits like reduced recovery time, minimized scarring, and shortened hospital stays, ultimately driving their adoption.</p><p>Additionally, the market is experiencing technological advancements in prosthetic valve designs to improve outcomes and patient comfort. The advent of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) procedures has provided an alternative to SAVR, especially for high-risk or inoperable patients. However, SAVR remains the gold standard for treating severe aortic valve diseases in younger and low-risk patients, sustaining its demand in the market.</p><p>Overall, the Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement Market is poised for significant growth due to increasing disease prevalence, aging demographics, advancements in surgical techniques, and ongoing developments in prosthetic valve designs.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Aortic Stenosis</li><li>Aortic Regurgitation</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The surgical aortic valve replacement market finds its application in treating various heart conditions. Aortic stenosis refers to the narrowing of the aortic valve, which restricts blood flow out of the heart. Aortic regurgitation is caused by the leakage of blood back into the heart due to a defective valve. Both these conditions can be effectively treated using surgical aortic valve replacement. Additionally, this procedure may also be used for other heart conditions that require the replacement of the aortic valve, ensuring proper blood flow and overall heart health.</p></p>
