<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fluid Coolers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Evaporative Coolers</li><li>Dry Air Cooler</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Fluid coolers, commonly used in industrial processes, can be classified into two main types: evaporative coolers and dry air coolers. Evaporative coolers use the principle of evaporative cooling to lower the temperature of a fluid by passing it through a wetted media, which causes evaporation. This process is highly efficient and cost-effective but requires a water source. On the other hand, dry air coolers use air as the cooling medium and require no water source. They transfer heat from the fluid to the surrounding air through a heat exchanger, making them more suitable for water-scarce areas.</p></p>
