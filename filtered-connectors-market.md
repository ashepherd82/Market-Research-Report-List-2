<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Filtered Connectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Low Pass</li><li>High Pass</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Filtered connectors are electronic components used to control the flow of signals in a circuit. Low-pass filtered connectors allow low-frequency signals to pass through while attenuating higher frequencies, preventing interference. They are commonly used in audio and telecommunications applications. On the other hand, high-pass filtered connectors allow high-frequency signals to pass through while blocking lower frequencies. These connectors are often used in radio frequency transmission and filtering applications. Both types of connectors play a vital role in ensuring signal integrity and minimizing signal interference in electronic systems.</p></p>
