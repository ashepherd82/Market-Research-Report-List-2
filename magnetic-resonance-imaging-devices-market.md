<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Magnetic Resonance Imaging Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Traditional Closed MRI</li><li>Open MRI Scan</li><li>Standing or Sitting MRI</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The traditional closed MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) device is a tube-like structure where the patient lies down on a table and enters the narrow opening. This type provides high-quality images but may cause discomfort for individuals with claustrophobia. Open MRI scans offer a more spacious design, accommodating patients who are hesitant or unable to fit in a closed MRI. Standing or sitting MRI market devices allow patients to be scanned in an upright position, beneficial for detecting certain issues that might appear during weight-bearing positions.</p></p>
