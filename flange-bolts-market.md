<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flange Bolts Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Partial Thread</li><li>Full Thread</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The flange bolts market comprises two types: partial thread and full thread. Partial thread flange bolts have a threaded portion that covers only a part of the bolt's length, leaving the remainder unthreaded. This design offers increased resistance to stripping and allows for easy removal. In contrast, full thread flange bolts have threads that cover the entire length of the bolt. They offer maximum grip and stability, making them suitable for applications requiring higher tensile strength. Both types have their specific uses and advantages in different industries.</p></p>
