<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Glass Wool Insulation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Produced in Rolls</li><li>Produced in Slabs</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Glass wool insulation is a type of thermal insulation material commonly used in buildings to reduce heat transfer and improve energy efficiency. This insulation material is often produced in two different forms - rolls and slabs. Glass wool produced in rolls is a flexible option that can be easily cut and installed between wall studs, while glass wool produced in slabs is firmer and more rigid, making it suitable for insulating large areas such as roofs or ceilings. Both forms provide effective thermal insulation and contribute to reducing energy consumption in buildings.</p></p>
