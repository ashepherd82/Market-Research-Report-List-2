<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Modular Hospital Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Permanent Modular</li><li>Relocatable Modular</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The modular hospital market consists of two main types: permanent modular and relocatable modular. Permanent modular hospitals are constructed off-site and then transported to their final location, where they are assembled permanently. These hospitals are built to withstand long-term use and typically serve as permanent healthcare facilities. On the other hand, relocatable modular hospitals are also built off-site but can be disassembled and moved to different locations as needed. These hospitals offer flexibility and can be utilized temporarily in areas with urgent healthcare needs or in emergency situations.</p></p>
