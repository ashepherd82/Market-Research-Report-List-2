<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Jewelry Grade Lab Grown Diamonds Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CVD</li><li>HPHT</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The jewelry grade lab-grown diamond market is divided into two types: CVD (chemical vapor deposition) and HPHT (high pressure high temperature). CVD diamonds are created by introducing hydrocarbon gas into a chamber where it is heated, breaking down the molecules and depositing carbon onto a diamond seed. HPHT diamonds are formed by subjecting carbon to intense pressure and high temperature, mimicking the natural diamond formation process. Both methods produce high-quality diamonds with similar physical and chemical properties to natural diamonds, offering consumers ethical and sustainable options.</p></p>
