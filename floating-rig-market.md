<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Floating Rig Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Jackup</li><li>Semi-Submersibles</li><li>Drillships</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The floating rig market consists of three primary types: jackup rigs, semi-submersibles, and drillships. Jackup rigs are mobile platforms supported by legs that can be raised or lowered to enable drilling in shallow waters. Semi-submersibles are self-propelled and can be partially submerged to provide stability during drilling in deeper waters. Drillships are also self-propelled vessels with a complete drilling package on board, enabling drilling in deep waters. Each type of rig serves specific purposes and is used based on the water depth and drilling requirements.</p></p>
