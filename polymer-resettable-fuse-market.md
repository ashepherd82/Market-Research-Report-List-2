<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polymer Resettable Fuse Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>In-Line</li><li>Surface Mount</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polymer Resettable Fuses are available in two market types: In-Line and Surface Mount. In-Line fuses are designed to be inserted into a circuit like a traditional fuse, offering protection against overcurrents. These fuses are used in various applications, including automobiles, industrial equipment, and consumer electronics. Surface Mount fuses, on the other hand, are soldered directly onto the circuit board, making them smaller in size and suitable for densely populated PCBs. They provide the same level of protection as In-Line fuses but are more space-efficient, making them ideal for compact electronic devices.</p></p>
