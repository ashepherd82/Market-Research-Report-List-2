<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Central Inverters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Roof-mounted</li><li>Floor-mounted</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Central inverters are integral components of solar power systems that convert DC (direct current) electricity into AC (alternating current) electricity. Roof-mounted central inverters are installed directly on the roof of a building, reducing the need for additional space and minimizing installation costs. They are commonly used in residential and small-scale commercial applications. In contrast, floor-mounted central inverters are installed on the ground and are typically used in larger solar power plants and utility-scale applications. They require more space and are designed to handle higher AC power outputs.</p></p>
