<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pneumatic Parallel Gripper Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Acting</li><li>Double Acting</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The pneumatic parallel gripper market consists of two types: single acting and double acting grippers. Single acting grippers use a spring mechanism to close the gripper and require pressurized air to open it. They are commonly used when a gripping force is needed only in one direction. On the other hand, double acting grippers use air pressure to both open and close the gripper, making them suitable for applications requiring bi-directional gripping force. Both types are utilized in various industries for automation and handling tasks.</p></p>
