<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Swine Influenza Vaccines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Live Vaccines</li><li>Killed Vaccines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Swine Influenza Vaccines are divided into two main types: Live Vaccines and Killed Vaccines. Live vaccines contain weakened or modified forms of the influenza virus, which can still replicate in the body but do not cause severe illness. These vaccines stimulate a strong immune response, providing long-lasting protection against the virus. On the other hand, killed vaccines consist of inactivated influenza viruses that cannot replicate in the body. They are unable to cause infection but still trigger an immune response, leading to the production of protective antibodies. Both types of vaccines play a crucial role in preventing and controlling swine influenza infections.</p></p>
