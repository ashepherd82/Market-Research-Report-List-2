<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Aircraft Tugs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Towbarless Tractors</li><li>Conventional Tractors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The electric aircraft tugs market comprises two main types: towbarless tractors and conventional tractors. Towbarless tractors are designed to move aircraft without the need for a separate towbar, making them more efficient and maneuverable. They use a tractor unit that securely attaches to the aircraft's nose or landing gear for towing. On the other hand, conventional tractors require a towbar to connect with the aircraft and tow it. Both types serve the purpose of assisting in moving aircraft on the ground, but towbarless tractors offer additional advantages in terms of flexibility and ease of use.</p></p>
