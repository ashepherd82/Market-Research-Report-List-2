<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spacesuit Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Low Pressure Spacesuit</li><li>Hyperbaric Spacesuit</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The spacesuit market can be categorized into two types: Low Pressure Spacesuit and Hyperbaric Spacesuit. A Low Pressure Spacesuit is designed to maintain a lower pressure than the surrounding environment, creating a protective barrier for astronauts. It is primarily used during extravehicular activities (EVAs) outside the spacecraft. On the other hand, a Hyperbaric Spacesuit is designed to withstand higher pressures, making it suitable for deep-sea exploration or missions in pressurized environments. Both types serve different purposes, ensuring the safety and functionality of astronauts in various settings.</p></p>
