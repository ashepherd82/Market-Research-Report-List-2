<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mobile Development Platforms Software Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cloud Based</li><li>Web Based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Mobile development platforms software market includes cloud-based and web-based platforms. Cloud-based platforms are hosted on remote servers, allowing developers to access and develop applications from anywhere using web browsers. This eliminates the need for local installations and offers scalability and flexibility. On the other hand, web-based platforms are accessed through web browsers but installed on the developer's local machine. They offer similar productivity tools and features but lack the scalability and ease of remote accessibility provided by cloud-based platforms. Both types cater to mobile app development needs but differ in infrastructure and accessibility.</p></p>
