<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Li-ion Battery for Mobile Phones Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Nickelâ€“Cadmium Cell (NiCd)</li><li>Nickel Metal Hydride Battery( NiMH)</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Li-ion Battery for Mobile Phones Market Types:</p><p>Nickel-Cadmium Cell (NiCd): The nickel-cadmium cell was one of the earliest rechargeable battery technologies and was commonly used in early mobile phones. It offers a relatively low energy density but has a long cycle life and can handle high discharge rates. However, it suffers from the "memory effect" and contains toxic cadmium, making it less environmentally friendly.</p><p>Nickel Metal Hydride Battery (NiMH): The nickel metal hydride battery is an improved version of the nickel-cadmium cell. It provides a higher energy density and is more environmentally friendly as it does not contain toxic heavy metals. NiMH batteries also have a longer cycle life than NiCd cells. However, they still suffer from the memory effect to some extent and can self-discharge more rapidly than Li-ion batteries.</p></p>
