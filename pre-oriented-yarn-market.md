<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pre-Oriented Yarn Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>SEMI DULL Series</li><li>Bright Series</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Pre-oriented yarn (POY) is available in different market types, including SEMI DULL Series and Bright Series. SEMI DULL Series yarn has a slightly matte and less lustrous appearance due to the addition of additives during the manufacturing process. This type of yarn is widely used in fabrics that require a more subtle sheen. On the other hand, Bright Series yarn has a high sheen and glossy finish, which is achieved by minimizing additives and maximizing the polymer's inherent luster. This yarn is popular in the production of textiles that demand a flamboyant appearance.</p></p>
