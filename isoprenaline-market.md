<p><strong>The Isoprenaline Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bronchial Asthma</li><li>Atrioventricular Block</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Isoprenaline is a medication widely used in the treatment of bronchial asthma, specifically in cases of acute bronchospasm. It functions as a bronchodilator by relaxing the muscles in the airway passages, facilitating easier breathing. Additionally, Isoprenaline finds application in the management of atrioventricular block, a condition characterized by impaired electrical conduction between the atria and ventricles of the heart. Isoprenaline increases heart rate and improves electrical conduction in these cases. Moreover, its usage extends to other medical conditions where bronchodilation or increased heart rate is required for therapeutic purposes.</p></p>
