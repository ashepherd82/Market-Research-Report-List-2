<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Marine Propeller Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Controllable Pitch Propeller</li><li>Fixed Pitch Propeller</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The marine propeller market encompasses two main types: controllable pitch propellers (CPP) and fixed pitch propellers (FPP). Controllable pitch propellers have adjustable blades, allowing the pitch to be altered during operation, enhancing efficiency and maneuverability. FPP, on the other hand, have fixed blade angles and are typically more economical for less demanding applications. While CPPs offer greater control and adaptability, FPPs are preferred for their simplicity and cost-effectiveness, catering to different needs across the marine industry.</p></p>
