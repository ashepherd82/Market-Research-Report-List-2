<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Portable Sandblasting Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry</li><li>Wet</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The portable sandblasting machine market can be categorized into two types: dry and wet. Dry sandblasting involves using compressed air to propel abrasive materials onto the desired surface, while wet sandblasting utilizes water along with the abrasive material. Both methods have their advantages; dry sandblasting is faster and more efficient for heavy-duty tasks, but it produces more dust and debris. On the other hand, wet sandblasting minimizes dust generation and provides a smoother finish, but it may require more time and effort for certain applications.</p></p>
