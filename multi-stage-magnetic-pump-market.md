<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Multi-stage Magnetic Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Stationary Shaft</li><li>Rotating Shaft</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The multi-stage magnetic pump market can be classified into two types based on the shaft design: stationary shaft and rotating shaft. In a stationary shaft magnetic pump, the impeller is connected to the stationary shaft, which remains fixed while the motor-driven rotor rotates around it. On the other hand, a rotating shaft magnetic pump consists of a rotating shaft that connects the motor-driven rotor directly to the impeller. These different shaft designs provide options for manufacturers to cater to varying requirements and preferences in the market.</p></p>
